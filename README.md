# iced-examples-mcp

An MCP server for guiding your coding LLM about the [iced](https://iced.rs) ecosystem.
LLMs know Rust pretty well, but don't know much about all the ways to build GUIs using Iced.
This MCP server fills in the gap.

## Warning

Very experimental now.

## Try it out

Link coming soon!

## Use it locally

```bash
cargo run -- "--http"
```

The server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8080`
